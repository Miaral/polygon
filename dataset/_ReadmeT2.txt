TERASHIMA2 data set 

Description: 480 Irregular test instances 
Artificially created data set with convex and non-convex polygons.
Procedure described by López-Camacho, 2012.
In each instance name, the number after letter C is the number of non-convex pieces.
Example: Instance TA001C5.txt has 5 non-convex pieces.
(Except in instances TU***C*C*.txt and TX***C*C*.txt, in which the number of 
non-convex pieces may vary).


For each instance we report:
- first line: the number N of pieces;
- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.
- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN.  
  Coordinates are counterclockwise.

Optimum is known and it is given.  
Optimum placing for <INSTANCE>.txt is in file Op<INSTANCE>.txt

For each file Op<INSTANCE>.txt we report:
- first line: the number of objects followed by how many pieces are in each object.
- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.
- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN
  where each piece is placed in the optimal solution.
